# Area-calculator-of-shapes


Create a base class by the name Shape which contains a method by the name “area”.
Create different subclasses of Shape class, each of these subclasses should represent a specific shape such as circle, square etc.
Override area method in the subclasses according to the shape that the class represents.
For example, the area method in circle class should calculate the area on the basis of radius and pi, the area method in rectangle class should calculate area on the basis of length and breadth.
